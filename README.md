# Z Task Manager

The **Z Task Manager** is a straightforward, efficient way to manage and track your tasks and time. With Z Task Manager, you can input tasks along with their start and end times, and the application will automatically calculate each task's duration. By saving tasks locally, the application allows you to view your task history and track your time usage even after refreshing the page. 

Keep your workflow clean by deleting completed tasks regularly, which frees up space and helps you stay organized.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add tasks with task names, start, and end times.
- **Automatic Time Calculation**: Get an automatic duration calculation for each task.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Tasks are saved locally, meaning they remain even after the page refreshes.
- **Manage Completed Tasks**: Keep your task list organized by deleting completed tasks to free up space.

## How to Use

1. **Add a Task**: Enter the task name, start time, and end time. The app will calculate the duration automatically.
2. **View Task List**: Your task list displays each task with its calculated duration, start time, and end time.
3. **Delete Completed Tasks**: Remove tasks that are done to keep your list organized.
